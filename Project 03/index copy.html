        <h1>About the Author</h1>
        <h1>Jillian Katz</h1>
        <h2>The Recipe Inspiration Generator is a tool developed by avid baker and recent coder Jillian Katz.  Having been immersed in the world of baking since childhood, I'm constantly seeking fresh recipes to delight my loved ones with new treats. However, I've found myself relying too heavily on a handful of beloved recipes lately. Endless scrolling through Pinterest and multiple baking blogs became the norm in my quest for new ideas. This tool is my solution to break free from my culinary comfort zone. With this generator, I aim to explore diverse variations of each baked good in the gallery, ensuring I never bake the same thing twice. </h2>
